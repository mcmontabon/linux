## ðŸ’» Exercises

Below are the commands I used to perform the activity. Trial and Error.

> wget

> man wget

> wget [url]

> wget [url] â€”page-requisites

> wget [url] â€”page-requisites â€”rejected-log-rejects.log

> wget [url] â€”page-requisites â€”rejected-log-rejects.log â€”span-hosts

> wget [url] â€”page-requisites â€”rejected-log-rejects.log â€”span-hosts â€”convert-links

And there's a part creating get.sh file. Below is the command structure:

wget [url] \
--page-requisites \
â€”-rejected-log-rejects.log \
â€”-span-hosts \
â€”-convert-links
â€”-recursive \
â€”-level=inf \
â€”-no-parent \
â€”-wait=2 \
â€”-limit-rate=1024k

This is the part get.sh needed to change the permission first.

> chmod +x ./get.sh

Then run, ./get.sh

Shortening the wget command. Get version first.

> wget or > wget â€”-version

Final command for the â€˜get.shâ€™ file:

> wget [url] -p -k -r -l inf -np

or you can use:

> wget [url] -pkrlinf -np
